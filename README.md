# Smart-Egg-Incubator
#FINAL THESIS PROJECT
SMEGGI (Smart Egg-Incubator) for Poultries and Gamefowl

Hardware components:
*Arduino Uno
*ESP8266 NODEMCU(WIFI Module)
*dht22(humidity and tempearature sensor)
*AC motor
*Ceramic heater
*Wires
*Breadboard
*Relay(5V)


#EGG INCUBATOR
The implementation of Smart Egg-Incubator contains the creation of an automated egg incubator which automatically adjust the
atmosphere inside the incubator for the standard envvironment needed for hatching eggs. The AC motor will be controlled through
a relay and will be responsible for the rotation of the egg tray so that each side of the eggs would receive the heat needed.


#WEB SERVER
As the microcontroller will be connected through internet, a third party web server(API) is used to provide a safe data storage and uses 
real-time data transfering for swift data monitoring of the poultry famers including the end users.


#MOBILE APPLICATION
The UX is designed for easy use and pleasing to the eyes of the user. The data is displayed in a form of a graph that has a timestamp
for easy data comparison on the mobile app in order to monitor the status of the incubator while you are away in your local area.
